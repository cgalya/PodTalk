# podtalk
 
podtalk is a social podcast sharing application that creates a community where people can talk about, listen to, and keep up to date with their favorite podcasts.  Users can build a profile that displays their saved favorite podcasts and participate in conversations about each week's episode as it is released.

This app utilizes the iTunes search api to retrieve the RSS feed for each podcast and then converts that feed into JSON.  The RSS data is used to build a page for each individual podcast episode that includes the description, audio, and a space for conversation.
